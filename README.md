# Duo-Doodle

## Artist
As the artist, you will be given a prompt. It is your job to make each prompt
come to life using only your drawing skills! Learn how well you did by
submitting your drawing. You will know if you created a good representation
of the prompt if others can guess correctly. Being an artist is fun,
but no worries, you'll also have the chance to be the guesser.

## Guesser
As the guesser, you will let the artist know how well they did! A correct guess
means the artist did a great job. But, Hurry! Submit your guess using the
submit button before the other guessers have a chance or the timer runs out.
The first person to guess correctly wins the round. Guessing is fun, but no
worries, you'll also have the chance to be the artist.
